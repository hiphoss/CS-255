DriverPass System Design Project
Project Overview
This project was part of the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course. The goal was to design a system for DriverPass, a company that needed an easy and efficient way for students to schedule driving tests and for instructors and admins to manage those appointments.

I created two main documents for this project:

Business Requirements Document (Project One): Collected the client’s needs and outlined the system requirements.

System Design Document (Project Two): Designed the system using UML diagrams and descriptions to show how the system should work.

Both documents are included in this repository.


Reflection
So, the DriverPass project was about building a system where students could schedule their driving tests and instructors could manage everything easily. The idea was to make the whole thing simple and smooth for both sides.

I think I did a pretty good job turning what the client wanted into a design that makes sense. Everything important was covered, and the diagrams help show how it would all work.

If I were to do it again, I’d make the documents flow a little better. Some parts could be explained more clearly so people don’t have to guess what I meant. More examples or visuals probably would have helped too.

When figuring out what users needed, I tried to really picture how they would use it day-to-day. Like, what’s the easiest way for a student to sign up and schedule a test without getting lost? That’s super important — if people can’t use it easily, it kind of defeats the purpose.

When I design stuff like this, I usually break things down by user type and figure out what each person needs to do. I’ll definitely keep using diagrams and user stories in the future to help map everything out and keep things simple and user-friendly.
